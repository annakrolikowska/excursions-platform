# Excursions platform :airplane:

In this project, the challange was to create platform, which consists of two parts - in the first panel, you are able to create an excursion offer as an **admin** and in the second panel, you can purchase order as a **client**. Excursions and orders are stored in database - **API** running on **JSON Server**.  Details are presented below.

## :gear: Installation

The project uses [node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [JSON server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server). 


To run it locally you should install all dependencies:

    npm i

To run webpack and create a localhost port you should type:

    npm start
    
To run JSON-server you should type in second terminal:

    json-server --watch ./data/excursions.json
    
Both panels should be available at:

-  http://localhost:8080/
-  http://localhost:8080/admin.html
